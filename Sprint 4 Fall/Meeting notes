Meeting Notes
●	Planning on week 1+2, trying 3
●	Currently working on Client model and audio player
●	Clarified files (decibel controlled by client)
●	Wireframes good, try to made side bar scroll with the page rather than scrolling away
○	Cut unneeded fields for training vs test (we may need to keep some as hidden fields?)
●	Discussed test expectations (mono vs dual ear on tests)
