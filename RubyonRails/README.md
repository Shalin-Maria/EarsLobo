# Ears Project
## Overview
The goal of this project was to rebuild an old application into a new web application using Ruby on Rails. The original software had licensing issues and needed to be replaced with a scalable web app.

As of Spring 2023, a basic working version of the new web app is completed. It contains all the base functionality, including signing in, adding clients to test, performing tests on said clients, and submitting tests. There are some minor visual discrepancies, but the backend is up and working and the webapp still performs the set-out goals.

The remaining tests need to be implemented, including RDDT and others, along with the lists for those other tests and the working test. There are 5 lists per test type, and currently, only 1 test and list work for 1 type of test. The app also needs much more rigorous testing and ensuring of no minor bugs / visual problems. This may require some reformatting of design choices.

## Installation
To install the old software:

Request keys from Deborah
Visit https://www.dichoticsinc.com/ and download the software
Input the license keys and begin
To install the new web app:

Set up a Ruby on Rails environment on your system. It's in Ruby on Rails 6 with ruby version 3.1.1 (make sure the ruby version is correct in gemfile on your local branch).
https://human-se.github.io/rails-demos-n-deets-2021/ can help you set it up.
Get access to the Github through Deborah and create your own local branch to make changes from.
Begin working!
## Database
### UML Diagram
The ideal originally designed UML diagram is not currently in use. The current working version of the UML diagram is not available at this time.

## Description
The system uses Ruby's built-in database and stores users/clinicians (these are the same, basically just the people running the test), clients (people being tested), and tests (results of the test). It should work properly and uses Bootstrap 4 for styling.

## Technical Details
### Design Process
The general design process for the skeleton of this project centered around the examples and information provided in the Demos and Deets for Ruby on Rails. The relations and database items follow the same format. https://human-se.github.io/rails-demos-n-deets-2021 is a link to setting up Ruby on Rails Environment.

## Front End Development
The front end of the project primarily was designed to be simple and in your face. Where possible, we avoided small text dropdowns and tab systems used commonly in the old app.

## Back End Development
The back end development focused mainly on successful client creation and saving, as well as test saving and creation.

## JavaScript
The largest and most complex JavaScript that will be necessary to use and understand when creating new and different tests on the app is the page. This contains all the logic for calculating a child’s diagnosis in real-time based on the buttons checked and age of the client.

## General Tips for Success
Commit as you go as soon as features are enabled.
Use all tools at your disposal, team members, AI, professors, etc.
Ensure your team feels comfortable pointing out problems with code and ensure no one gets butthurt about suggestions or changes.
Always outcome-oriented, do not sit on options or problems, pick the agreed-upon direction and move towards it.
Use the Ruby on Rails Demos and Deets for basic examples of setting up databases, relations, etc.
Known Problems
There have been issues with bootstrap features not working, and this is why some pages contain direct links to features at the top. If additional bootstrap features do not work, try that. There have been issues with the test page not updating for certain people and no reason why. The JavaScript script on the test page will sometimes not provide errors if changes made do not work; it will just stop outputting the values. Ensure any changes to this page are correct before applying or just implement tiny changes at a time to the test page. This will save huge headaches when troubleshooting the script. You may need to revert GitHub commits if you cannot diagnose why the JavaScript is not working (this was necessary in initial development).




## Extra Information
The code contains documentation for all major features done by each group member. Future groups have discretion to change, update, and manipulate the code at Deborah’s approval and instructions.
